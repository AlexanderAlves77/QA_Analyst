## Projects Overview

### qa-e2e-automation-suite
End-to-End test automation framework for web applications.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Maven, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG.
*   **Features:** Page Object Model (POM), explicit waits, parallel execution, ExtentReports integration, reusable components.

### qa-test-api
Comprehensive framework for testing RESTful APIs and performing database validations.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Maven, RestAssured, TestNG, Hibernate, MySQL.
*   **Features:** Fluent API validations, database state verification using Hibernate, global exception handling for API tests, data-driven testing.

### data-driven-framework
A robust, reusable core framework designed to power data-driven testing across all projects. This is the foundational engine for handling test data, configurations, reporting, and utilities.
*   **Tech Stack:** Java, Maven, Apache POI, TestNG, Log4j2, ExtentReports, ReportNG, JavaMail API.
*   **Core Capabilities:**
    *   **Data Management:** Excel readers/writers for test data, properties file handlers for configuration.
    *   **Reporting & Logging:** ExtentReports for rich HTML reports, ReportNG for TestNG integration, comprehensive logging with Log4j2.
    *   **Utilities:** Email modules for sending reports, ZIP archiving for historical reports, screenshot capture on failure.
    *   **Execution Control:** TestNG listeners for soft assertions and failure analysis, runmode controllers (smoke/sanity/regression), custom TestNG configurations.
    *   **Infrastructure:** Database connection utilities, Jenkins integration ready, parallel execution support.

* * *
